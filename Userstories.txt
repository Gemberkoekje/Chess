As a player I want to see a chessboard when I start the game so that I can play the game. (DONE in Unity)
As a player I want the chessboard to be set up properly, so that I can start the game.
  - Rooks on the outside corners
  - Knights inside the rooks
  - Bishops inside the knights
  - Queen central square of same color
  - King on vacant spot next to queen
  - Pawns one square in front of all other pieces
  
As a developer I want to set up custom boards, so that I can check moves more easily.
